%% List of Functions 
% The Antarctic Mapping Tools (AMT) package for Matlab contains functions for working with Antarctic geospatial data and creating maps in Matlab. These
% functions are called by several data-specific plugins for AMT. 

%% Accessing Documentation 
% To access documentation for any AMT function, simply type |amt| followed by the name of
% the function. For example, to view the documentation for <ll2ps_documentation.html
% |ll2ps|>, type 
% 
%  amt ll2ps
%
%% Help Getting Started 
% For help getting started, check out this page called <AMT_getting_started.html AMT Getting Started>.

% by name, geo coordinates, or polar stereographic coordinates, and can create inset maps.

%% Mapping in unprojected coordinates 
% Oceanographers seem to like making maps in unprojected coordinates, where longitudes 
% are plotted as x values, latitudes are y values, and south is always on the bottom. 
% Unprojected coordinates tend to have quite a bit of spatial distortion near the poles, 
% but if your data are gridded in equally-spaced lats and lons, it might make sense to 
% give each grid cell equal real estate in your plot. If you want to plot in unprojected
% coordinates, simply use Matlab's standard plotting functions, but replace x with lon and 
% y with lat. For example, 
% 
%  plot(lon,lat) 
%  pcolor(lon,lat,z) 
% 
% and so forth. AMT does not provide much support for plotting in unprojected 
% coordinates. In fact, as of now there's just one function for unprojected coordinates: 
% 
% * <inset_unproj_documentation.html |inset_unproj|> creates an inset map for plotting 
% in unprojected coordinates. 

%% Mapping with Matlab's Mapping Toolbox
% I've recently been moving away from dependence on Matlab's Mapping Toolbox because most folks
% don't have it, it's expensive, it's often computationally inefficient, and troubleshooting 
% can be a bear. Nonetheless, if you do use Matlab's Mapping Toolbox, these functions might 
% make your life a little more convenient: 
% 
% * <antmap_documentation.html |antmap|> initializes a polar stereographic
% map centered on the South Pole. The |antmap| function can also be called to place a
% grid or "graticule". 
% * <mapzoom_documentation.html |mapzoom|> calls |antmap| and zooms to any
% location given by geo coordinates or by location name. The |mapzoom|
% function can also create inset maps for zoomed regions. 
% * <scarlabel_documentation.html |scarlabel|> labels features by looking up their locations in the SCAR database. 
% * <scarlabel_documentation.html |corelabel|> labels ice core locations. 
% * <scarclick_documentation.html |scarclick|> lets you click on a map to get the names of features.  
% * <scalebar_documentation.html |scalebar|> places a graphical reference scale
% on a map. 
% * <shadem_documentation.html |shadem|> applies topographic relief shading to
% DEM data. 
% * <quivermc_documentation.html |quivermc|> shows formatted vector fields such as wind, ice, or water motion.  
% * <coord_documentation.html |coord|> returns geo- or polar stereographic coordinates from mouse clicks.  
% * <clickz_documentation.html |clickz|> returns gridded z data such as elevation or velocity interpolated mouse click locations.    

%% Helper functions 
% A couple of functions exist mostly in the background, but were developed
% at some point or another to assist an AMT plugin.  
%  
% * |islatlon| is used for input parsing to determine whether function inputs are likely georeferenced coordinates. 
% * |find2drange| returns matrix indices corresponding to a range of input coordinates. This is sometimes used to find relevant pixel indices before loading a large gridded dataset, however
% for most applications |find2drange| can now be replaced by |inpsquad|. 
% * |C2xyz| converts a Matlab-formatted contour matrix to x,y,z values. 
%

% Please, feel free to develop and share your own AMT plugins.  

%% Getting started with AMT
% If you're new to AMT, new to glaciology, or new to Matlab, I recommend going through 
% the tutorial called <AMT_getting_started.html AMT Getting Started>. It will walk you 
% through some of the basics. Then go though the documentation files for each of the functions
% and make sure you understand how the work. If anything doesn't make sense or doesn't work, drop me a line
% and I'll be glad to help troubleshoot. 

%% More examples 
% Taking inspiration from musical <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_book
% _fake books_>, I have written a number of AMT-related example files and I'm
% calling them a <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52377
% Glaciology Fake Book>. The Glaciology Fake Book is intended to 
% 
% # teach how scientific results were obtained, 
% # ensure scientific repeatability, and 
% # provide examples of how to use AMT functions. 
% 
% In addition to the Glaciology Fake Book, I've written a few other examples which rely 
% heavily on AMT. <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55352-how-to-estimate-subglacial-water-routes/content/subglacial%20water%20routing/html/How_to_estimate_subglacial_water_routes.html
% How to estimate subglacial flow accumulation> uses TopoToolbox to generate subglacial water routing maps. 
% and <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49693-how-to-drape-landsat-images-over-bedmap2-topography/content/html/LandsatElevationDrape.html 
% How to drape Landsat images over Bedmap2 topography> explains, well, how to drape Landsat images over Bedmap2 topography.
